I believe that the situation is the problem and not Srushti
I believe there is some solution that lies that we are not able to get it because of communication issues.
We both are strongly agreeing with our inner mind and not noticing each other’s action and efforts.
We both seems to be frustrated with this relationship
I cannot provide what she is looking for
She cannot say what she wants clearly. Also, she should say what she doesn’t want
She wanted me to be available to her all the time. When she calls me, I should not put my phone on silent.
She tries to hurt herself by consuming chalk and threaten herself because she thinks she is the problem
I am stressed because I am failing in all the aspects of my life.
I am also negative at times.
Everytime I try to recover, she brings up the last topic of the fight. 
I cry as a man every 2 days in a week. It is painful
I feel mental torture
Today after the call with my parents, her mood was good, so I wanted to do something for both of us. I wanted to play old songs and it will also give me more relief. I asked her, “Can I play song for you”, she got defensive and started bringing the old fight topics.
I don’t want to understand what’s going on in her mind. I want to understand what should I DO. What exactly should I DO so that it will create peace between us.
I don’t want to lose myself and be quiet because that will give a strong message to her about my hatred towards her. I do not hate her. I love her. I genuinely love her.
My mind can only handle some things. My biggest weakness is that I change my mind a lot, and I don’t know what to do career wise, Should I go to Delaware and be a weak person. Or, should I stay here and thrive
There are somethings in my mind that causing me to go to do drugs.
Sometimes I think problem is ME and Srushti is suffering because of me
Why should I waste someone else’s life when its not their fault. 
Biggest thing for me is Srushti and I feel like a failure because I do anything or not do anything and that will result into a fight. 
I think I am so low category. Not disciplined to do anything
I am dependent on her. I want to see her smile
I want to see her happy
I want to say I love you every time, and I mean it
I want to kiss her. When i close my eyes and kiss her. From somewhere I get this positive energy. A sense of calmness
I don’t understand why she is negative. What is causing her to make the statement that I want distance? My behavior
May be sometimes I don’t pick up her phone
Am I doing this intentionally and everytime?
What triggers me the most is that when she try to hurt herself
I think that is because I gave her my heart and I really care about her.
I really don’t know what action to take. I ask her and she says “Don’t worry, I will make distance”
She is my fiance and she talks about not coming back to my life
I believe she is my wife and she wants to die.
She also says that she will le6ave me when I have everything
I told her multiple times that when I hug her, I feel like I have everything, but she cannot recall that when she talk about leaving me.
I don’t know everything. I am equal to a common man who is making observations and acting accordingly. I just want to act
My state of mind is not at peace. Headache, Stress of Job, Stress of Loan, Stress of being a burden on someone. My mind is not performing the best.
She smiles at me with not her willingness.
She got blade out today to cut herself.  I was feeling dizzy in the morning. I really needed her help today. I was feeling depressed today when I talked to my parents.
She said I insulted her in front of my parents. Why she cannot say “Hey Dhruv, can I tell you one thing, I did not like when you said …… to me. I felt it this way. Can you not do this again please, it does affect my self respect  or whatever it is” I swear to god, the above statement is actionable (I can take action on - Do Not or Do something because I felt this different) In the next encounter of this problem, my brain will recall this incident, and I will stop it completely
This being said, the communication part is missing here where I am communicating and I feel like Srushti is partially communicating.
I told her to write on this document and she did not follow it. I told her to turn the camera to her, she did not follow it. She believe she is doing everything I ask for. 
Before she use to care about the stress I was having and now she cares less about me.
She don’t ask me what I ate anymore
